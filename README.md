## Description

AnimeSaturn Intro Skipper is a Chrome extension developed using Manifest V3. The extension enhances your AnimeSaturn experience by automatically adding start and end timestamps for anime intros. Once you save these timestamps, the extension offers an option to automatically skip the intro when you watch the same anime again.

## Features

- **Auto Timestamps**: Easily add start and end timestamps for anime intros on AnimeSaturn.
- **Intro Skip**: The extension recognizes when you watch a specific anime and offers to automatically skip the intro for a seamless viewing experience.
- **Customizable**: You can manually edit or delete saved timestamps for fine-tuning the intro skip feature.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.

## How to Use

1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Visit AnimeSaturn and start watching an anime.
3. When the intro starts playing, click the "Add Intro Timestamp" button in the extension popup to save the start and end timestamps.
4. The extension will now recognize the anime and automatically offer to skip the intro the next time you watch it.
